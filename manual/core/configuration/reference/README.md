## Reference configuration

The `reference.conf` file is packaged in the `java-driver-core` JAR artifact. It is used at runtime
to provide default values for all configuration options (anything that is not overridden in a custom
`application.conf` or with system properties).

Here is a [link to the file in our GitHub
repository](https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/blob/4.0.1/core/src/main/resources/reference.conf).
